# Project: ProteinPilot

## Overview
ProteinPilot is an AI-powered health and fitness application that automates protein tracking through food image recognition and provides personalized meal planning. The system serves both fitness enthusiasts tracking nutritional goals and medical users requiring strict protein logs, with integrated grocery ordering capabilities and HIPAA-compliant data security.

## Template Analysis Requirements
**CRITICAL**: Before implementing ANY features, thoroughly analyze the provided template.
The template already includes authentication, database, and core infrastructure.
Focus on understanding and extending what's already there.

## Phase 1: Template Analysis & Adaptation
### Objectives
- Run the template and document all existing functionality
- Map template features to project requirements
- Identify which existing components can be reused
- Plan modifications to existing components
- Document gaps that need new development

### Tasks
- [ ] Run `npm install && npm run dev` and explore all template features
- [ ] Document authentication flow (already implemented by template)
- [ ] Review database schema and plan extensions (not replacements)
- [ ] Inventory all UI components and their capabilities
- [ ] Map existing routes to required features
- [ ] Create adaptation plan documenting what to modify vs build new
- [ ] Document HIPAA compliance requirements and how to adapt template auth system

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete template feature inventory documented
- [ ] Existing components mapped to requirements
- [ ] Database extension plan created (keeping existing schema)
- [ ] UI component reuse strategy documented
- [ ] Gap analysis complete (what's missing from template)
- [ ] HIPAA compliance plan for template authentication system

## Phase 2: Core Features (Extending Template)
### Objectives
- Extend existing database schema for food, nutrition, and meal planning data
- Modify template components for core protein tracking functionality
- Build new features that leverage template infrastructure
- Implement primary user workflows using existing auth

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Real-time food image recognition system extending template's file upload capabilities
- [ ] Automated protein tracking module integrating with template's data models
- [ ] Basic meal planning engine leveraging template's user preference system
- [ ] User dashboard built on template's existing dashboard components
- [ ] Core data models extending template schema with food items and nutritional data
- [ ] HIPAA-compliant data handling using template's security foundation

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Core features work within template's architecture
- [ ] Database extensions compatible with template schema
- [ ] Authentication flow unchanged (using template's system with HIPAA enhancements)
- [ ] New features integrate seamlessly with template
- [ ] Image recognition achieves >80% accuracy on common protein-rich food items
- [ ] Protein calculation accurate within 5% of actual nutritional values

## Phase 3: Enhanced Features
### Objectives
- Add project-specific advanced features
- Enhance UX beyond template defaults
- Implement custom business logic for adaptive meal planning

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Advanced adaptive meal planning system that learns from user feedback
- [ ] Notification system built on template's existing notification infrastructure
- [ ] User feedback mechanism for improving AI recognition accuracy
- [ ] Analytics dashboard showing protein intake trends using template's charting components
- [ ] Machine learning pipeline for improving food recognition accuracy

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Enhanced features maintain template's patterns
- [ ] Performance remains optimal (sub-300ms response times)
- [ ] User experience improvements measurable
- [ ] Meal planning improves recommendation accuracy by 15% with user feedback
- [ ] Users can rate and provide feedback on all AI-generated content
- [ ] Analytics dashboard shows weekly/monthly protein intake patterns

## Phase 4: Integration & Polish
### Objectives
- Integrate grocery delivery services with template's API integration patterns
- Polish UI while maintaining template's design system
- Optimize performance and user experience

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Grocery service integration with major delivery APIs (using template's API architecture)
- [ ] Shopping list generation from meal plans with direct ordering capability
- [ ] Refined UI/UX design using template's component system
- [ ] Integration with third-party fitness trackers (Apple Health, Google Fit)
- [ ] Performance optimizations ensuring sub-300ms response times
- [ ] Affiliate system for grocery integration

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Integrations work smoothly using template's API patterns
- [ ] UI maintains consistency with template's design system
- [ ] Performance metrics meet targets
- [ ] Responsive design works across devices
- [ ] Users can order groceries directly from the app
- [ ] UI/UX improvements reduce task completion time by 25%

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
### Objectives
- Test all custom features thoroughly
- Ensure template features still work correctly
- Deploy using template's deployment configuration

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite covering features and security
- [ ] HIPAA compliance validation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Production deployment using template's CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting system
- [ ] Security hardening and penetration testing

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All user flows tested end-to-end
- [ ] No regressions in template functionality
- [ ] Deployed successfully using template's setup
- [ ] Monitoring and error tracking configured
- [ ] All tests pass with 95%+ code coverage
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities remain
- [ ] HIPAA compliance formally validated

## Implementation Notes
- DO NOT rebuild authentication - extend template's existing system for HIPAA compliance
- DO NOT create new database connections - extend existing schema with food/nutrition models
- DO NOT replace UI component library - modify template's components for protein tracking
- DO leverage template's existing patterns and API integration methods
- DO read template's documentation before making changes
- DO extend template's notification system for dietary alerts
- DO use template's charting components for analytics dashboards

## Key Principles
1. **Extend, Don't Replace**: Work with template's existing systems for auth, database, and UI
2. **Reuse Components**: Prefer modifying existing dashboard, forms, and chart components
3. **Maintain Patterns**: Follow template's established API and component patterns
4. **Respect Architecture**: Integrate grocery APIs using template's existing integration approach
5. **Security First**: Enhance template's security model to meet HIPAA requirements without rebuilding
