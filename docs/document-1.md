# Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

## Overview
ProteinPilot is an AI-powered nutrition platform that automates protein tracking through advanced computer vision and machine learning. This document outlines the technical requirements to build a robust, scalable, and secure solution for protein tracking, personalized meal planning, and grocery integration. The platform serves fitness enthusiasts, medical users, and individuals with specialized dietary needs.

## System Architecture
### High-Level Architecture
- The system will utilize a microservices architecture that decouples image recognition, meal planning, user management, and third-party integration (grocery delivery).
- Cloud-based hosting will be used to ensure scalability and high availability.
- Data storage will be secured and compliant with healthcare regulations (HIPAA) where applicable.

### Core Components
- AI and Machine Learning Module: Performs image recognition and personalized recommendation through continuous model training with user feedback.
- API Gateway: Routes service calls between the front-end, back-end, and third-party services.
- User Data Management: Handles sensitive nutrition and health data with robust encryption.
- Integration Module: Manages connections with grocery delivery and meal kit services.

### Data Flow Diagram (ALT-text)
An ALT-text diagram depicts a flow from user mobile devices sending image data to the AI module, which communicates with the database and integrates with external grocery APIs, while the API Gateway orchestrates data flow and authentication.

## Functional Requirements
### User Authentication & Data Privacy
- Provide secure login using industry-standard encryption.
- Meet HIPAA-certified storage and data encryption standards.
- Monitor and audit logins and data access.

### Image Recognition & AI Personalization
- Develop robust image recognition for real-time food identification.
- Utilize machine learning to adapt meal planning based on user dietary habits and feedback.
- Ensure continuous training and performance monitoring of the models.

### Integration with Third-Party Services
- Integrate with grocery delivery APIs.
- Support affiliate APIs for meal kit services.
- Maintain a modular design to add future integrations easily.

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Scalability & Performance
- Design for 100% scalability to support increased user loads.
- Achieve high performance with response times under 300ms for key functionalities.
- Implement caching and load balancing to maintain system stability.

### Reliability & Security
- Ensure system uptime of 99.9% using distributed architecture.
- Include regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
- Utilize HIPAA-certified cloud storage for sensitive data.

### Technical Constraints and Assumptions
- Assume continuous data input from user devices and third-party API updates.
- Accept that technology limitations might require periodic updates to the image recognition module.
- Monitor evolving compliance regulations to adjust security protocols.
