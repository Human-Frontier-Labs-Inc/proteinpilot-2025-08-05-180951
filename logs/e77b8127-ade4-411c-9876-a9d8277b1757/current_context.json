  "user_prompt": "\ud83d\udd27 PHASE 3: ENHANCED FEATURES & INTEGRATION\n\nTime to enhance and integrate\\! You should have core functionality working now.\n\nPHASE 3 OBJECTIVES:\n1. Add advanced features beyond the core workflow\n2. Integrate any third-party services mentioned in requirements  \n3. Enhance the user experience with better UI/UX\n4. Add data validation and error handling\n5. Implement any real-time features or notifications\n\nSPECIAL INSTRUCTION FOR TESTING:\nUse mock authentication following Clerk protocol for agentic testing. Don't require real Clerk setup - create mock auth that follows Clerk's patterns so the app can be tested autonomously.\n\nFOCUS AREAS:\n- Performance optimization\n- User experience improvements\n- Integration with external APIs\n- Advanced functionality from the requirements\n- Polish the core features\n- Mock auth for testing (Clerk-compatible)\n\nYou have 30 minutes for this phase. What enhanced features will you add first?",
